# known issues

## rust inlay

no inlay notes in rust programs. so no warnings, etc.

## [done] auto-close

quotes, curlies, etc, don't automatically close when typing

## [done] weird autocomplete

autocomplete completes with a carriage return. we don't want that. need ^Y to complete.

## indentation

still doesn't work properly. a new if statement doesn't indent for example

too many spaces for indents

## [done] indentation highlight

when cursor is inside a block of code, it gets highlighted

## highlight words under cursor

find other copies of that token and highlight them slightly

## linting

is linting set up?

## formatting

F8 to format

## typescript

is typescript working?

## invisible files not in fuzzy find window
