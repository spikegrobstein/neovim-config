# neovim-config

This is based off of LazyVim starter template, but has been customised for my own opinionated way of using neovim.

to use:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/spikegrobstein/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

then launch neovim to complete the installation.
